<p align="justify">
Program Explanation: This program is a program to predict the possible risk of default on credit card use. The idea is to use existing data, then go through data preparation namely checking for missing values and types, changing data objects to numeric, handling outliers, solving unbalanced data, feature selection, splitting test-trained data, building a classification model with features that have been determined, and provide an evaluation of the model.
